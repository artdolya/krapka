# KrapkaNet.Repositories.Abstractions

Repository Pattern is a design pattern that mediates between the domain and data mapping layers using a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects.

- IRepositoryReader<T, in TKey> - Is a read-only interface for accessing your data.
- IRepositoryWriter<T> - Is a write-only interface for accessing your data.
- IRepositoryRemover<in T, in TKey> - Is a remove-only interface for accessing your data.
- IRepository<T, in TKey> - Is a read-write interface for accessing your data.
